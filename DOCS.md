# ATV 2.0 — Deeper Documentation

This file holds the deep-dive material that used to live in `README.md`. The README now focuses on what ATV is, how to install it on macOS/Linux/Windows, and the full sprint of where each skill fits. Everything else — pillar internals, learning pipeline mechanics, agent inventory, install architecture, and the full skill reference — lives here.

## The Three Pillars

### Karpathy Guidelines — the behavioral foundation

Every skill and agent in ATV operates under four principles derived from [Andrej Karpathy's observations](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2015883857489522876) on how LLMs fail at coding. These are installed as a skill (`.github/skills/karpathy-guidelines/SKILL.md`) and shape how Copilot approaches all work:

| Principle | What it prevents |
|---|---|
| **Think Before Coding** | Wrong assumptions, hidden confusion, silently picking one interpretation |
| **Simplicity First** | Overcomplication, bloated abstractions, speculative features |
| **Surgical Changes** | Drive-by refactoring, touching code you shouldn't, cosmetic "improvements" |
| **Goal-Driven Execution** | Vague success criteria, no verification loop, "make it work" without checking |

These aren't just instructions — they're the operating contract between you and the AI. Without them, Copilot tends toward the exact pitfalls Karpathy described: "The models make wrong assumptions on your behalf and just run along with them."

### Autoresearch — autonomous experimentation loop

For tasks with a measurable metric — performance tuning, test pass rate, bundle size, latency, build time — `/autoresearch` runs an autonomous loop: define the goal + metric + scope, the agent works on a dedicated `autoresearch/<tag>` branch, committing each experiment, running the metric command, and keeping or reverting based on the result. Every experiment is logged to `results.tsv` so you can audit the research trail when the loop ends.

Installed as a skill (`.github/skills/autoresearch/SKILL.md`). Sourced from [github/awesome-copilot](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot/blob/main/skills/autoresearch/SKILL.md) (MIT) by [@luiscantero](https://github.com/luiscantero), inspired by [Karpathy's autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch).

**Use when** you have a measurable outcome and want the agent to hill-climb autonomously. **Skip for** one-shot tasks, simple bug fixes, or anything without a clear metric.

### Compound Engineering — knowledge compounds

A gated pipeline where each step produces an artifact the next step consumes:

```text
/ce-brainstorm → /ce-plan → /ce-work → /ce-review → /ce-compound
```

Every time you run `/ce-compound`, solved problems get saved to `docs/solutions/`. Next time `/ce-plan` runs, the `learnings-researcher` agent searches those files first. Your repo gets smarter with every PR.

### gstack — the AI sprint process

30 slash-command skills covering office hours, engineering review, browser QA, shipping, deploy verification, security audits, and weekly retros. gstack doesn't just give the AI more tools — it gives it a *role*. `/gstack-review` acts as a staff engineer. `/atv-security` (which absorbed the former `/cso` skill) acts as a chief security officer. The skills are opinionated engineering processes encoded as markdown.

Includes safety guardrails (`/gstack-careful`, `/gstack-freeze`, `/gstack-guard`) that prevent destructive commands like `rm -rf` or force-pushes.

### agent-browser — the eyes of the agent

A native Rust CLI that controls Chrome via CDP with ~100ms latency. Uses snapshot refs (`@e1`, `@e2`) for deterministic element selection — no CSS selectors or XPath needed. The `open → snapshot → interact → re-snapshot` workflow fits cleanly into an LLM's tool-calling loop.

## The Guided Experience

The guided installer (`--guided`) walks you through four screens:

**1. Stack Packs** — Multi-select your stacks (TypeScript, Python, Rails). Auto-detected packs are pre-selected.

**2. Preset** — Choose your depth:

| Preset | What you get |
|---|---|
| **Starter** | Core CE workflow (13 skills). No network calls, instant install. |
| **Pro** | + gstack sprint skills (35+ skills total) |
| **Full** | + browser QA, benchmarks, agent-browser, Chrome (45+ skills). Requires Bun. |

**3. Customize** — Power users can drill into category-grouped multi-select. Beginners skip straight to install.

The customize screen exposes opt-in skill layers grouped by intent:

| Layer | Contents |
|---|---|
| **`core-skills`** | Planning, lifecycle, learning, quality, security, behavioral guidelines |
| **`orchestrators`** | LFG, SLFG, ralph-loop, feature-video, test-browser |
| **`dev-tools`** | git-worktree, git-commit / git-commit-push-pr, ghcp-review-resolve, onboarding, reproduce-bug, skill-creator, todo-create / -resolve / -triage, changelog, git-clean-gone-branches |
| **`style-skills`** | dhh-rails-style, andrew-kane-gem-writer, dspy-ruby, every-style-editor, frontend-design |
| **`media-skills`** | gemini-imagegen, proof, rclone |
| **`easter-eggs`** | memeIQ |

**4. Install + Summary** — Real-time progress with structured telemetry, then actionable next steps.

## How Learning Works

Most AI coding tools treat every session as day one. ATV remembers.

Every time you start a Copilot session, the AI has no memory of how *your team* writes code — that you wrap errors with `%w`, prefer table-driven tests, or use constructor injection. ATV fixes this with a **continuous learning pipeline** that observes how you code, extracts reusable patterns, and graduates proven ones into permanent Copilot skills.

### The Loop

```text
You code normally
     ↓
Observer hooks silently capture tool use → .atv/observations.jsonl
     ↓
/learn analyzes observations + git history → instincts with confidence scores
     ↓
Confidence grows with each session (0.5 → 0.6 → 0.7 → 0.8)
     ↓
/evolve promotes mature instincts → .github/skills/learned-*/SKILL.md
     ↓
Next session: Copilot already knows your patterns
```

### Observer Hooks

ATV installs hooks for all 6 Copilot lifecycle events (`sessionStart`, `sessionEnd`, `preToolUse`, `postToolUse`, `userPromptSubmitted`, `errorOccurred`). A lightweight Node.js script captures every tool interaction to `.atv/observations.jsonl` — silently, with zero impact on your workflow.

### Instincts

`/learn` analyzes git history, diffs, observations, and existing solutions to find recurring patterns. Each becomes an "instinct" with a confidence score:

```yaml
# .atv/instincts/project.yaml
instincts:
  - id: always-wrap-errors
    trigger: "when returning an error from a function"
    behavior: "wrap with fmt.Errorf using %w"
    confidence: 0.85
    observations: 12
```

Run `/instincts` to see the dashboard:

```text
  Error Handling (2 instincts)
    ★ always-wrap-errors        0.9  "wrap errors with fmt.Errorf %w"    15 obs
    ● sentinel-errors           0.6  "use sentinel errors for expected"   5 obs

  Testing (1 instinct)
    ★ table-driven-tests        0.85 "use table-driven test pattern"     12 obs

  Legend: ★ ready to evolve (>0.8)  ● active  ○ tentative (<0.5)
```

When an instinct reaches >0.8 confidence, `/evolve` promotes it into a full SKILL.md at `.github/skills/learned-*/`. Copilot auto-discovers these — your AI assistant now *permanently knows* your team's conventions.

### Design Decisions

- **Instincts are committed to git** — the whole team benefits, not just one developer
- **Observations are gitignored** — raw data is ephemeral, instincts are permanent
- **Generated skills use `learned-` prefix** — visually distinct from hand-written skills
- **Confidence scoring prevents noise** — only well-established patterns get promoted

---

## De-Slop

AI coding assistants have a tell: over-abstraction, `// This function handles the logic for...` comments, purple-to-blue gradients. Code review catches bugs — but nobody catches *slop*.

`/unslop` runs three parallel analysis passes on your recent changes:

```text
/unslop                          →  Report slop in changed files
/unslop src/components/          →  Scope to a directory
/unslop fix                      →  Auto-apply safe fixes
```

| Pass | What it catches | Example |
|------|----------------|---------|
| **Code Slop** | Over-abstraction, YAGNI violations, nested ternaries | Interface used once → inline it |
| **Comment Rot** | Obvious restatements, AI filler phrases, stale TODOs | `// This function handles auth` → delete |
| **Design Slop** | Generic gradients, template layouts, missing hover states | Purple-to-blue default → use brand palette |

`/unslop` is wired into both autonomous pipelines — `/lfg` runs `/unslop fix` after review, and `/slfg` runs the report pass in parallel with `ce-review` and browser testing for zero added wall-clock time.

`/ce-review` asks "is this correct?" — `/unslop` asks "does this look human-written?" Run both.

## Memory Architecture

ATV builds seven layers of memory across three reinforcing cycles:

| Layer | Where | Timescale |
|---|---|---|
| **Observations** | `.atv/observations.jsonl` | Per-session (gitignored) |
| **Instincts** | `.atv/instincts/project.yaml` | Grows every session |
| **Evolved skills** | `.github/skills/learned-*/` | Permanent |
| **Institutional knowledge** | `docs/solutions/*.md` | Permanent |
| **Design decisions** | `docs/brainstorms/*.md` | Permanent |
| **Implementation plans** | `docs/plans/*.md` | Per-feature |
| **Install manifest** | `.atv/install-manifest.json` | Per-install |

**How they reinforce each other:**

- **Knowledge compounding** (per-PR): `/ce-compound` saves solved problems → future `/ce-plan` finds them via `learnings-researcher` → fewer repeated mistakes
- **Pattern learning** (per-session): observer hooks → `/learn` → instincts → `/evolve` → permanent skills → Copilot knows your conventions
- **Team propagation** (per-commit): instincts are committed to git → the whole team inherits learned patterns without a style guide

Over weeks, your repo develops a memory that makes every Copilot session more effective than the last.

 Write manifest to .atv/install-manifest.json
```

All templates are embedded at compile time — no runtime network calls for the core scaffold. gstack requires a network clone (~22MB). Re-running is idempotent: existing files are skipped, JSON configs are merged.

---

## Development

```bash
go build -o atv-installer .             # build
go test ./...                            # all tests
go test ./pkg/installstate/ -v           # manifest + recommendations tests
go test ./pkg/monitor/ -v                # watcher + drift detection tests
go test ./test/sandbox/ -v               # integration tests (E2E scenarios)
```

## Limitations

- **Bun required for browser skills** — `/gstack-qa`, `/gstack-browse`, `/gstack-benchmark`
- **Network required for gstack** — clones ~22MB at install time
- **gstack setup on Windows** — falls back to `bun run gen:skill-docs` (bash path issues)
- **Token-heavy pipelines** — long multi-agent sessions can hit context limits
